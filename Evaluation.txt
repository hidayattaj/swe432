I followed the HTML Foundations guidelines, ensuring a strong foundational structure for the web page. I started with basic markup and element usage, making sure to use proper HTML tags and attributes throughout the document. I wrote the correct Document Type Declaration, a well-structured <head> section, and a neatly organized <body> content. I used <div> elements to keep all the objects of the page structured. Then to enhance the semantic meaning of the content, I incorporated HTML5 semantic elements like <header> for page headers, <nav> for navigation menus, and <article> for structuring individual pieces of content. I implemented Lists, including ordered lists for step-by-step instructions, unordered lists for bullet-point information, and description lists for defining terms. Additionally, I incorporated advanced HTML elements like <dialog> for interactive modals and <figcaption> to caption figures properly. Furthermore, I effectively embedded media elements, such as <audio>, to provide an enriching user experience. Lastly in CSS section, I used flex box property, hover, positions, and many more to create good design for the pages.
